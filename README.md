## Installation Guide

This application can be run via the command line. 


1. Create a new development environment called `loanqualifier` and install the libraries contained in the requirements section above.

  * From your terminal instance, create a new virtual environment called `atmdev`, using the following code:

    ```code
    conda create -n loanqualifier python=3.7 anaconda
    ```

  * Activate the new `loanqualifier` environment as follows:

    ```code
    conda activate loanqualifier
    ```

  * Navigate to the root of this activity folder and install the provided requirements using the following code:

    ```code
    pip install questionary
    pip install fire
    ```

2. Open [`atm.py`](atm/atm.py) and review the Python script. Then open [`utils.py`](atm/utils.py) and [`make_withdrawal.py`](atm/actions/make_withdrawal.py). You'll be completing the following functions:

  * `verify_pin(pin)`, located in the utils module

    * Verify that the length of the pin is six characters.

      * If true, print a validation message and return `True`.

      * If false, then return `False`.

  * `make_withdrawal(account)`, located in the actions folder

    * Use `make_deposit(account)` as a guide.

    * Complete the docstring using the docstring from `make_deposit(account)` as a guide.

    * Use the Questionary library to ask the user how much they want to deposit. Set the return equal to the variable `amount`. Make sure that `amount` is a floating point value.

    * If `amount` is less than or equal to 0.0, exit the system with an error message indicating that itâ€™s not a valid withdrawal amount.

    * Validate that `amount` is less than or equal to `account["balance"]`.

      * If the amount is valid, adjust the `account["balance"]` for the withdrawal, and print a confirmation message and return the adjusted account.

      * If the amount isn't valid, exit the system with an error message that tells the user that they don't have enough money in the account to cover the withdrawal.

3. Run your application!
